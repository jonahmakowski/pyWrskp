W2: Just a minute, can you stop?
M2: What’s the matter?
W2: I’m bored with this conversation.
M2: You’re what?
W2: The conversation doesn’t interest me.
M2: Oh?
W2: Can you talk about something else?
M2: Certainly, if you want me to. I do apologize for boring you.
W2: Not you, your conversation. You weren’t to know, I was trying to look interested. My fault.
M2: You mean you should have looked bored?
W2: No, I should have told you straight away I wasn’t interested.
M2: Hm. Does this happen often?
W2: What?
M2: Finding yourself saddled with a crashing bore?
W2: You are not a crashing bore.
M2: Just an ordinary bore.
W2: I’ve offended you.
M2: Me? Why should I be offended. You’re the one who should be offended, having to put up with a crashing bore.
W2: You are not …
M2: After all, if one’s a crashing bore it’s best that one’s told. Thank you. For telling me. That I’m a …..
W2: Stop it.
M2: Am I boring you again?
W2: Listen. Stop it and listen, be quiet and shut up and listen. It’s quite simple. You were talking about something which didn’t interest me. I should have let you know at once. Instead I pretended to be interested. It was my mistake. I apologize.
M2: Oh, don’t apologize, I should apologize, I’m the bore.
W2: You’re not listening…..
M2: And now I have news for you. May I tell it, at the risk of boring you?
W2: Go on.
M2: This conversation is boring me. So shall we change the subject? Or better still, since we both find each other such crashing bores, perhaps I’ll but the television on.
W2: I don’t want television, I want to talk to you.
M2: In spit of the fact that I’m ….
W2: Please. Stop it, please, please.
M2: The sad thing is, I was only telling you that story because I thought you might be interested, It was of no interest to me.
M2: What’s wrong?
W2: Hm?
M2: What’s the matter?
W2: With what?
M2: With you.
W2: Nothing as far as I know. Why?
M2: Something obviously is.
W2: Why, what have I said?
M2: You haven’t said anything.
W2: Well then.
M2: You still manage to make it pretty obvious you’re upset about something.
W2: I don’t know what gives you that idea. You’re probably feeling a bit morose, so you imagine I’m upset.
M2: I’m not morose.
W2: No? You’re not exactly cheerful, are you?
M2: Do you expect me to be cheerful when you’re like this?
W2: Like what?
M2: You know very well.
W2: Are you blaming me for it?
M2: For what?
W2: For your moroseness.
M2: I’m not morose and I’m not blaming you for anything.
W2: Oh do leave me alone. I don’t know why it is you take everything so personally.
M2: What are you talking about?
W2: The minute I’m a little under the weather you go around as if it’s the end of the world. You make me feel so guilty.
M2: If you’d just tell me what I’ve done wrong.
W2: Why shouldn’t I feel a bit low now and then? You’re depressed often enough. I don’t automatically assume it’s something I’ve done.
M2: I know you don’t.
W2: You mean it usually is something I’ve done. Oh do leave me alone. If I’m such a depressing influence why don’t you go out?
M2: I don’t want to go out a leave you like this.
W2: You’re not doing much good staying, are you? Face as long as a fiddle. You’re making me feel guilty.
M2: Look, I can’t help it if I’m affected by your moods.
W2: Moods. Is that what you think they are?
M2: I can’t be happy if you’re upset. I’m sorry…
W2: Well I’m very sorry but there’s nothing I can do about it.
M2: I’m not saying there is.
W2: Well then. Go out, leave me alone. Go out and have a drink or something. I’ll be all right. No point in both of us being miserable.
M2: Oh God… I’m no help am I?
W2: Obviously not.
M2: Well am I? Is there anything I can do?
W2: No. I said no.
M2: I’m going out then.
W2: Where to?
M2: I don’t know. For a walk. All right?
W2: Wait.
M2: What?
W2: Don’t leave me.
W2: So you’re going at last.
M2: Seems like it.
W2: Is that a yes or a no?
M2: Unless you’ve got some other idea.
W2: I’ve run out of ideas. Why, do you have any other ideas?
M2: If I had I supposed I wouldn’t be going, would I?
W2: I suppose not. Anyway, I’ve tried everything.
M2: You’ve tried everything?
W2: We’ve both tried everything, I suppose. I suppose there’s no point in hanging on. No point in trying again. No point in going over the same old ground again and again and again. Best to give up, I suppose. Cut one’s losses. Go, go. Try with somebody else.
M2: There’s nobody else.
W2: You’ll find somebody else.
M2: So will you.
W2: I daresay. Not to worry about me.
M2: We did agree it would be best.
W2: I know we agreed. I’m say, go, go. Only.
M2: Only what?
W2: It’s your decision.
M2: My decision!
W2: Just so long as you realize. It’s your decision.
M2: We both agreed…
W2: We Botha agreed but it’s your decision, it’s still your decision. You’re the one who’s going.
M2: One of us has to go.
W2: And you’re the one. You’ve made a decision to go. I haven’t. I can’t make decisions for you. Just so long as you realize.
M2: Do you want me to go?
W2: I want you to make your own decision and do your own thing. I’m not going to hold you back. If you want to go. I also don’t want to be—held responsible—if you do.
M2: Do you want me to go?
W2: I want you to do as you think fit!
M2: Do you want me to go! Do you want me to go!!
W2: No. Do you want to go?
M2: No. Oh, what else is there to say?
W2: We’ll find something.

**Create Python Documentation for Script**
=====================================

As a software developer specializing in writing Python documentation, create a comprehensive documentation for the following Python script. The document should be written in Markdown format.

### Program Overview
-------------------

The provided Python script is designed to [briefly describe the program's purpose or functionality]. This document will provide an overview of the script's functions and classes, along with explanations and examples.

### Table of Contents
-----------------------------

Here is a table of contents listing all the functions and classes in the script:

*   [Function 1](#function-1)
    *   Description: Briefly describe what Function 1 does.
    *   Parameters: List any input parameters required by Function 1.
    *   Returns: Describe any output or return values produced by Function 1.

*   [Class 1](#class-1)
    *   Description: Briefly describe what class 1 does.
    *   [Method 1](##method-1)
        *   Description: Briefly describe what method 1 does.
        *   Parameters: List any input parameters required by method 1.

*   **Returns**: Describe any output or return values produced by the function.

### Example Usage
-----------------

Provide examples of how to use each function and class in the script. This will help users understand how to integrate these functions into their own codebase.

Please follow this format for your documentation:
```markdown

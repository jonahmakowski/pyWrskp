## Basic Explination
A package for useful code I use a lot!

## File Interaction
This package has two file interaction commands, ```read_file()``` and ```write_file()```. As the name states, ```read_file()``` reads the file that you give it and returns the result. As the neame states, ```write_file()``` writes information on a file that you give it.

## Encription
This package has two encription commands, ```encrypt()``` and ```decrypt()```. Both commands need a key, and a message.
The way this system works is it uses a ceaser cipher to encrypt the string. Please note that someone could decrypt this if they figure out the key.

## Odds and Ends
Odds and ends has functions that aren't long enough to need a full python file.
### Number Input
Simply, all this command does (```number_input()```) is get an input that must be a number, if the input is not a number, it tells the user, and asks them to try again.

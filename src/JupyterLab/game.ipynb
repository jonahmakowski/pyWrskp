    "The game is simple enough, but there are a couple things you need to know before you start playing, here is a list:\n",
    "- It is case sensitive (This means if it asks you for an attack for example it needs to be typed in as it is written)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the game works\n",
    "You can see the actual program, so if you still have questions, you might not be as good at coding, here are the basics of how the game works:\n",
    "- The game uses functions to execute things I use multipule times, like the monster_fight, and learn_spell functions.\n",
    "- It uses time.sleep() this allows me to make a pause in the program, making it so the player has to wait.\n",
    "- It uses loops so that I don't have to write a program many times\n",
    "- It uses random.randint() to find random numbers that I use for monster's health and other things\n",
    "- It uses variables (lists, strings, integers, dictionaries)"

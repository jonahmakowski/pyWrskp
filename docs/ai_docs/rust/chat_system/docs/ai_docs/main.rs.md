# AI Summary
The provided Rust code implements a very basic web server. It listens on port 7878, accepts TCP connections, and processes incoming HTTP requests. It only recognizes a specific GET request ("GET / HTTP/1.1") and responds with a "200 OK"; all other requests receive a "404 NOT FOUND" response. The code is a simple demonstration of basic networking and HTTP response handling in Rust.

The AI gave it a general rating of 6/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

Quality: The code is concise and functional for its simple purpose, acting as a minimal HTTP server. However, it lacks robustness, proper error handling (relying heavily on `unwrap()`), and advanced features necessary for a production-grade server (e.g., proper header parsing, serving actual content, concurrent handling). Conventions: The code generally adheres to Rust's naming conventions (snake_case for functions). While `unwrap()` is common in examples, it's generally advised to use more robust error handling in real-world applications, which slightly reduces the convention rating.# Functions

## main
### Explanation
This is the entry point of the program. It binds a TcpListener to "0.0.0.0:7878" and listens for incoming TCP connections. For each connection received, it calls the `handle_connection` function to process the request.
### Code
```rust
fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:7878").unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}
```

## handle_connection
### Explanation
This function takes a mutable TcpStream as input. It creates a BufReader to read from the stream. It then reads the first line of the incoming request. If the request line exactly matches "GET / HTTP/1.1", it sends a "200 OK" HTTP response. Otherwise, for any other request, it sends a "404 NOT FOUND" HTTP response. It also prints the received request line to the console.
### Code
```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let request_line = buf_reader.lines().next().unwrap().unwrap();

    if request_line == "GET / HTTP/1.1" {
        let response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n";

        stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        println!("Got valid request: {}", request_line);
    } else {
        let response = "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\r\n\r\n";
        stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        println!("Got invalid request: {}", request_line);
    }
}
```

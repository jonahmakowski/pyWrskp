# AI Summary
This program reads the first five lines from a file named 'test_file.txt' and prints them to the console. It includes error handling for file opening and ensures proper file closure.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and functional, but there are minor issues with line termination handling and some potential improvements in variable naming and error messages.
# Functions

## main
### Explanation
This function reads the first five lines from a file named 'test_file.txt' and prints them to the console. It handles potential errors when opening the file and ensures proper file closure.
### Code
```c
int main() {
    char line[100];
    FILE *fptr;

    fptr = fopen("test_file.txt", "r");
    
    if (fptr == nullptr) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        fgets(line, sizeof(line), fptr);
        line[strcspn(line, "\n")] = '\0';
        printf("Read line %d: %s\n", i + 1, line);
    }

    fclose(fptr);

    return 0;
}
```

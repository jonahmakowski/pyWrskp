# AI Summary
This program is a simple C program that prompts the user to enter their name and address, and then writes this information to a file named 'test_file.txt'. The program uses basic file handling functions to open, write to, and close the file.

The AI gave it a general rating of 7/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 8/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is functional and achieves its purpose, but it could be improved in terms of error handling and user input validation. The code follows basic C conventions, but there is room for improvement in terms of code organization and readability.
# Functions

## main
### Explanation
The main function of the program. It opens a file named 'test_file.txt' in append mode, prompts the user to enter their name and address, reads the input, and writes the name and address to the file. It then closes the file.
### Code
```c
int main() {
    FILE *ftpr;
    ftpr = fopen("test_file.txt", "a");

    char name[100];
    char address[200];

    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = '\0';

    printf("Enter your address: ");
    fgets(address, sizeof(address), stdin);
    address[strcspn(address, "\n")] = '\0';

    fprintf(ftpr, "Name: %s\n", name);
    fprintf(ftpr, "Address: %s\n", address);
    fclose(ftpr);

    return 0;
}
```

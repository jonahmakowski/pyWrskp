# AI Summary
This C++ program reads the first two lines from a file named 'test_file.txt' and prints them to the console. The program includes basic error handling for file opening and uses standard C functions for file operations and string manipulation. The code is straightforward and serves a simple purpose of reading and displaying file content.

The AI gave it a general rating of 7/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 8/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and follows basic conventions. The error handling is present, and the code is concise for its purpose. However, the use of C-style strings and file operations could be modernized with C++ features for better readability and safety.
# Functions
# Overall File Contents
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char line1[100], line2[100];
    FILE *fptr;

    fptr = fopen("test_file.txt", "r");

    if (fptr == nullptr) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    fgets(line1, sizeof(line1), fptr);
    fgets(line2, sizeof(line2), fptr);

    fclose(fptr);

    line1[strcspn(line1, "\n")] = '\0';
    line2[strcspn(line2, "\n")] = '\0';

    printf("Line 1: %s\n", line1);
    printf("Line 2: %s\n", line2);

    return 0;
}

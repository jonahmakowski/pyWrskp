# AI Summary
This file is a simple C program that prompts the user to enter their name and address, then writes this information to a file named 'test_file.txt'. The program uses basic file handling functions to achieve this. The code is straightforward and easy to understand, but it lacks error handling for file operations, which could lead to potential issues if the file cannot be opened or written to.

The AI gave it a general rating of 7/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 6/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. However, it lacks error handling for file operations, which could be improved. The variable names are descriptive, but the code could benefit from more comments to explain the purpose of each section.

    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = '\0';

    printf("Enter your address: ");
    fgets(address, sizeof(address), stdin);
    address[strcspn(address, "\n")] = '\0';

    fprintf(ftpr, "Name: %s\n", name);
    fprintf(ftpr, "Address: %s\n", address);
    fclose(ftpr);

# AI Summary
This C++ program generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) and prints it to the standard output. It initializes the random number generator using the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers on each run. The random number is calculated by taking a modulo of `rand()` and then scaling it to the desired range.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 9/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is concise, easy to understand, and effectively achieves its goal of generating a random number between 0 and 1. It adheres well to basic C/C++ programming conventions for a small utility program. The method of generating the float is clear, though using `(float)rand() / RAND_MAX` is a more standard library approach for a full range.
# Functions

## main
### Explanation
The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes the pseudo-random number generator using the current time as a seed. It then calculates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) by generating an integer between 0 and 10000 and dividing it by 10000.0. Finally, it prints this calculated random number to the console, formatted to four decimal places.
### Code
```cpp
int main() {
    srand(time(0));

    float random_number = rand() % 10001;
    random_number = random_number / 10000.0;

    printf("Random number between 0 and 1: %.4f\n", random_number);

    return 0;
}
```

# AI Summary
This program generates a random number between 10 and 40, ensuring it is not between 20 and 30. It uses the standard library functions for random number generation and output.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is functional and clear, but could benefit from better variable naming and comments.
# Functions

## main
### Explanation
The main function initializes the random number generator, generates a random number between 10 and 40, ensuring it is not between 20 and 30, and prints the result.
### Code
```c
int main() {
    srand(time(0));

    int value = 21;

    while (value > 20 && value < 30) {
        value = rand() % (40 - 10 + 1) + 10;
    }

    printf("Random number between 10 and 40, not between 20 and 30: %d\n", value);

    return 0;
}
```

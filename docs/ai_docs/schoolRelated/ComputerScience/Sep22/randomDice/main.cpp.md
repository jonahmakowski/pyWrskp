# AI Summary
The `main.cpp` file contains a single `main` function that simulates 100 rolls of a six-sided die. It uses C-style random number generation and output functions to count and display the frequency of each die face. The code is straightforward and effectively demonstrates a basic simulation.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 6/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is functional and concise, accurately simulating dice rolls and displaying frequencies, which contributes to a high quality rating. However, its adherence to C++ conventions is moderate; it uses C-style headers (`stdlib.h`, `time.h`, `stdio.h`), random number generation (`rand()`), and output (`printf`) instead of their modern C++ equivalents (`<random>`, `std::cout`), which are preferred in `.cpp` files. Additionally, the numbers 6 and 100 are "magic numbers" that could be improved by using named constants.
# Functions

## main
### Explanation
This function simulates rolling a six-sided die 100 times. It initializes the random number generator using the current time as a seed. It then generates 100 random numbers between 1 and 6, representing the outcomes of the die rolls. The frequency of each die face is stored in an array, and finally, it prints how many times each side (1 through 6) appeared during the simulation.
### Code
```cpp
int main() {
    srand(time(0));

    int dice_values[6] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        int random_number = rand() % 6 + 1;
        dice_values[random_number - 1]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        printf("Side %d: %d times\n", i + 1, dice_values[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

        int random_number = rand() % 6 + 1;
        dice_values[random_number - 1]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        printf("Side %d: %d times\n", i + 1, dice_values[i]);

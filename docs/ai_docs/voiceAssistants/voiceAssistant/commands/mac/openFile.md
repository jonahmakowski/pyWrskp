# Python Script Documentation

## Program Overview

The provided Python script is designed to search for a file on a macOS system and open it. It utilizes the `mdfind` command to search for the file and `PySimpleGUI` for user interaction if multiple search results are found. The script also includes functionality to play a voice message using the `audio` module.

## Table of Contents

  - Returns: The path of the file if found, or `False` if not found.
- [open_file](#open_file)
  - Description: Opens a file by searching for its path and using the `open` command.
  - Parameters: `file` (str, the name of the file to open)
  - Returns: `True` if the file was opened successfully, `False` otherwise.

## Detailed Function Descriptions

### find_path

**Description**: This function searches for the path of a given file using the `mdfind` command. If multiple search results are found, it prompts the user to choose the correct path using a GUI created with `PySimpleGUI`.

**Parameters**:
- `file` (str): The name of the file to search for.

**Returns**:
- The path of the file if found, or `False` if not found.

### open_file

**Description**: This function opens a file by first searching for its path using the `find_path` function. If the path is found, it uses the `open` command to open the file.

**Parameters**:
- `file` (str): The name of the file to open.

**Returns**:
- `True` if the file was opened successfully, `False` otherwise.

## Example Usage

### Example Usage for find_path

```python

    print(f"File found at: {file_path}")
else:
    print("File not found.")
```

### Example Usage for open_file

```

## Dependencies

- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `commands.mac.runTerminalCommand`: For running terminal commands.
- `audio`: For playing voice messages.
- `PySimpleGUI`: For creating the GUI to choose the correct file path if multiple results are found.

## Notes

- The script is designed to run on macOS systems.
- The `mdfind` command is used to search for files, which is specific to macOS.
- The `audio.speak` function is used to play a voice message, which requires the `audio` module to be properly configured.
- The `PySimpleGUI` library is used to create a simple GUI for selecting the correct file path if multiple results are found.

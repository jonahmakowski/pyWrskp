## Detailed Function Descriptions

### Environment Setup

#### Description

The script sets up the environment by loading environment variables, retrieving an AI token, and defining constants for the AI model and its URL. This setup is essential for interacting with the AI model.

#### Parameters

None

#### Returns

None

### Example Usage

Usage example for setting up the environment:

```python
from os import getenv
from pyWrkspPackage import *

# General Setup
load_dotenv()
AI_KEY = getenv('AI_TOKEN')
if AI_KEY is None:
    raise ValueError('AI_TOKEN is not set')

AI_MODEL = 'mistral-large-latest'
AI_URL = 'http://192.168.86.4:4001'
```

In this example, the script loads environment variables, retrieves the AI token, and defines constants for the AI model and its URL. The `load_dotenv()` function is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file, and `getenv('AI_TOKEN')` retrieves the AI token from the environment variables. If the AI token is not set, the script raises a `ValueError`. The `AI_MODEL` and `AI_URL` constants are then defined for use in interacting with the AI model.

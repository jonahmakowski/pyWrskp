**pyWrkspPackage Documentation**

**Summary:**
The pyWrkspPackage script is a Python package that provides a collection of helpful functions and classes for various tasks. It includes documentation, setup information, and metadata required to install and use the package.

**Functions and Classes:**

*   **setup**: This function is used to configure the installation of the pyWrkspPackage.
    *   Parameters: None
    *   Returns: None (sets up the package directory and dependencies)
*   **find_packages**: This function finds all packages in the specified directory.
    *   Parameters: `where="app"` (specifies the directory to search for packages)
    *   Returns: A list of found packages

**Dependencies:**

*   The pyWrkspPackage script depends on the following external packages/modules:
    +   [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/): a collection of tools for building, distributing, and installing Python packages
    +   [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): a library for loading environment variables from a .env file

**Code:**

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from setuptools import find_packages, setup

# Read the README file to generate the long description
with open("app/README.md", "r") as f:
    # Set the long description variable to the contents of the README file
    long_description = f.read()

# Define the setup function
setup(
    name="pyWrkspPackage",
    version="0.3.5",
    description="A group of helpful functions for Python",
    # Specify the package directory and find packages in the "app" directory
    package_dir={"": "app"},
    packages=find_packages(where="app"),
    # Set the long description from the README file
    long_description=long_description,
    # Set the content type of the long description to Markdown
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    # Specify the URL for the package repository
    url="https://github.com/jonahmakowski/pyWrskp",
    # Set the author and email addresses
    author="Jonah Makowski",
    author_email="jonah@makowski.ca",
    # Specify the license under which the package is released (MIT License)
    license="MIT",
    # Define the classifiers for the package
    classifiers=[
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    # Install the required dependencies, including python-dotenv
    install_requires=['python-dotenv'],
    # Specify additional dependencies for development mode (twine >= 4.0.2)
    extras_require={
        "dev": ["twine>=4.0.2"],
    },
    # Set the minimum Python version required to run the package (3.10)
    python_requires=">=3.10",
)

```

**Note:** The code has been commented and formatted for readability, but it does not contain any additional functionality or modifications beyond what is included in the original script.

**Python Script Documentation**

**Summary**

This Python script provides a set of utility functions to merge dictionaries, split lists into chunks, flatten nested lists, and load environment variables from a .env file.

**Functions and Classes**

### `dict_merge(d1: dict, d2: dict) -> dict`

Merges two dictionaries recursively. If a key in both dictionaries has a dictionary as its value,
the function will merge those dictionaries as well. Otherwise, the value from the second dictionary
will overwrite the value from the first dictionary.

**Inputs**

* `d1` (dict): The first dictionary to merge.
* `d2` (dict): The second dictionary to merge.

**Output**

* `dict`: The merged dictionary.

### `chunk_list(lst: list, size: int) -> list`

Splits a list into smaller lists (chunks) of a specified size.

**Inputs**

* `lst` (list): The list to be split into chunks.
* `size` (int): The size of each chunk.

**Output**

* `list`: A list of lists, where each sublist is a chunk of the original list.

### `flatten(lst: list) -> list`

Flattens a list of lists into a single list.

**Inputs**

* `lst` (list): A list of lists to be flattened.

**Output**

* `list`: A single flattened list containing all the elements of the sublists.

### `load_from_env(variable: str) -> str`

Loads the value of an environment variable from a .env file.

**Inputs**

* `variable` (str): The name of the environment variable to retrieve.

**Output**

* `str`: The value of the specified environment variable as a string.

### `list_to_str(list)`

Converts a list of items into a single concatenated string.

**Inputs**

* `list`: The list of items to be converted to a string.

**Output**

* `str`: A single string containing all items from the list concatenated together.

**Dependencies**

This script depends on the following external packages/modules:

* `dotenv` for loading environment variables from a .env file.
* `os` for accessing environment variables and other operating system functions.

**Code**
```python
# Import necessary modules
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

    Merges two dictionaries recursively. If a key in both dictionaries has a dictionary as its value,
    the function will merge those dictionaries as well. Otherwise, the value from the second dictionary
    will overwrite the value from the first dictionary.

    Args:
        d1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.

def chunk_list(lst: list, size: int) -> list:

    Splits a list into smaller lists (chunks) of a specified size.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a chunk of the original list.
              The last chunk may be smaller if the original list size is not
              perfectly divisible by the chunk size.

    Example:

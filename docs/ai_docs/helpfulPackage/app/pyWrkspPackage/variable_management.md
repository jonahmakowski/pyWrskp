**Python Script Documentation**

**Summary**
---------------

This Python script provides a set of utility functions for merging dictionaries, splitting lists into chunks, flattening lists, loading environment variables, converting lists to strings, and creating matrices. The script is designed to be flexible and reusable.

**Functions and Classes**
---------------------------

### `dict_merge(d1: dict, d2: dict) -> dict`

Merges two dictionaries recursively. If a key in both dictionaries has a dictionary as its value,
the function will merge those dictionaries as well. Otherwise, the value from the second dictionary
will overwrite the value from the first dictionary.

*   **Args**: `d1 (dict)` - The first dictionary to merge.
*   `d2 (dict)` - The second dictionary to merge.
*   **Returns**: `dict` - The merged dictionary.

### `chunk_list(lst: list, size: int) -> list`

Splits a list into smaller lists (chunks) of a specified size.

*   **Args**: `lst (list)` - The list to be split into chunks.
*   `size (int)` - The size of each chunk.
*   **Returns**: `list` - A list of lists, where each sublist is a chunk of the original list.
              The last chunk may be smaller if the original list size is not
              perfectly divisible by the chunk size.

### `flatten(lst: list) -> list`

Flattens a list of lists into a single list.

*   **Args**: `lst (list)` - A list of lists to be flattened.
*   **Returns**: `list` - A single flattened list containing all the elements of the sublists.

### `load_from_env(variable: str) -> str`

Loads the value of an environment variable from a .env file and retrieves
the value of the specified environment variable.

*   **Args**: `variable (str)` - The name of the environment variable to retrieve.
*   **Returns**: `str` - The value of the specified environment variable as a string.

### `list_to_str(list) -> str`

Converts a list of items into a single concatenated string.

*   **Args**: `list (list)` - The list of items to be converted to a string.
*   **Returns**: `str` - A single string containing all items from the list concatenated together.

### `make_matrix(rows: int, cols: int, default=None) -> list`

Creates a matrix (2D list) with the specified number of rows and columns.

*   **Args**:
    *   `rows (int)` - The number of rows in the matrix.
    *   `cols (int)` - The number of columns in the matrix.
    *   `default (optional)` - The default value to fill the matrix with. Defaults to None.

### `load_dotenv()`

Loads environment variables from a .env file using the `dotenv` library.

**Dependencies**
----------------

The script depends on the following external packages/modules:

*   `dotenv`
*   `os`

Here is the entire code with added comments:

```python
# Import the required libraries
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Function to merge two dictionaries recursively
def dict_merge(d1: dict, d2: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Merges two dictionaries recursively. If a key in both dictionaries has a dictionary as its value,
    the function will merge those dictionaries as well. Otherwise, the value from the second dictionary
    will overwrite the value from the first dictionary.

    Args:
        d1 (dict): The first dictionary to merge.
        d2 (dict): The second dictionary to merge.

    Returns:
        dict: The merged dictionary.
    """
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the second dictionary
    for key, value in d2.items():
        # Check if the current key exists in the first dictionary and its value is also a dictionary
        if isinstance(value, dict) and key in d1 and isinstance(d1[key], dict):
            # Recursively call `dict_merge` to merge the nested dictionaries
            dict_merge(d1[key], value)
        else:
            # Otherwise, update the value of the first dictionary with the current key-value pair from the second dictionary
            d1[key] = value
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return d1

# Function to split a list into smaller lists (chunks) of a specified size
def chunk_list(lst: list, size: int) -> list:
    """
    Splits a list into smaller lists (chunks) of a specified size.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list to be split into chunks.
        size (int): The size of each chunk.

    Returns:
        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a chunk of the original list.
              The last chunk may be smaller if the original list size is not
              perfectly divisible by the chunk size.

    Example:
        >>> chunk_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
        [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to create chunks of the specified size
    return [lst[i:i + size] for i in range(0, len(lst), size)]

    Args:

        list: A single flattened list containing all the elements of the sublists.
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to flatten the list

    """
    Creates a matrix (2D list) with the specified number of rows and columns.

    Args:
        rows (int): The number of rows in the matrix.

```

I hope this helps!

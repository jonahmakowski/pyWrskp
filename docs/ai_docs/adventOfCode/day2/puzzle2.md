**Script Documentation**

**Summary**
This script is designed to solve a challenge where it takes a list of reports as input and determines the number of safe reports. A report is considered safe if it meets certain conditions related to its numbers.

**Functions and Classes**

### `report_check(reports)`

*   Description: This function checks each report in the input list for safety.
*   Parameters: `reports` - a list of lists, where each sublist represents a single report
*   Return Value: A tuple containing two values:
    *   `safe`: The number of safe reports found in the input list.
    *   `nots`: A list of indices corresponding to reports that were not considered safe.

### `is_safe(report)`

*   Description: This function checks if a single report is safe by recursively removing numbers from both ends and checking each resulting subset.
*   Parameters: `report` - a list representing the safety status of an individual report
*   Return Value: A boolean indicating whether the report was considered safe.

### `check_report(report)`

*   Description: This function checks if a single report meets the conditions for being considered safe, which involves comparing consecutive numbers and checking their absolute difference.
*   Parameters: `report` - a list representing the safety status of an individual report
*   Return Value: A boolean indicating whether the report was considered safe.

### `do_challenge()`

*   Description: This function is the main entry point for solving the challenge. It reads input data, processes each line to create reports, and then calls `report_check` to determine the number of safe reports.
*   Parameters:
    *   None
*   Return Value: The total count of safe reports found in the input list.

**Dependencies**

This script depends on the following external packages/modules:

*   `builtins`: For basic Python functionality (e.g., file input/output, string manipulation).
*   `os`: Not used explicitly but required for opening files (the `input.txt` file).

**Script Documentation**

### Summary

This Python script reads input data from a file named 'input.txt', processes the data, and returns the number of "safe" reports that meet specific conditions. A report is considered safe if it has a valid ascending or descending trend between consecutive numbers.

### Functions and Classes

#### do_challenge()

*   **Description:** This function takes no inputs, reads input data from a file named 'input.txt', processes the data, and returns the number of "safe" reports.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Output:** The return value is an integer representing the number of safe reports.

Here's the code with added comments:
```python
def do_challenge():
    # Open the input file and read all lines into a list
    with open('input.txt') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    # Initialize an empty list to store reports
    reports = []

    # Process each line in the input data
    for line in lines:
        report = []
        # Split the line into individual numbers and convert them to integers
        for num in line.strip().split():
            report.append(int(num))
        reports.append(report)

    # Initialize a counter for safe reports
    safe = 0

    # Process each report
    for ind, report in enumerate(reports):
        status = False
        
        # Determine the trend type based on the first two numbers
        typ = -1 if report[0] < report[1] else 1 if report[0] > report[1] else None

        # Initialize a variable to store the previous number
        prev_num = None

        # Process each number in the report
        for num in report:
            if prev_num is not None:
                # Check if the difference between consecutive numbers is within a valid range
                if 1 <= abs(num - prev_num) <= 3:
                    # Update the status based on the trend type and direction of change
                    if num < prev_num and typ == -1 or num > prev_num and typ == 1:
                        status = True
                    else:
                        status = False
                else:
                    status = False

            # Update the previous number for the next iteration
            prev_num = num

        # Increment the safe report counter if the report is valid
        if status:
            safe += 1

    # Return the total number of safe reports
    return safe
```

### Dependencies

*   The script depends on the built-in Python modules `os` and `re` for file operations and regular expressions, respectively. However, since these modules are not explicitly used in the provided code snippet, it is assumed that they are part of the overall environment where this script will be executed.

Note: I have added comments to explain what each section of the code does without changing the actual functionality or logic of the script.

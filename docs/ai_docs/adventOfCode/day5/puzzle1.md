**Python Script Documentation**

**Summary:**
This script is designed to process input data from a file, parse rules and messages, check for validity, and compute a sum based on valid messages. The script uses the pyWrkspPackage module for loading data from a file.

**Functions and Classes:**

### 1. `parse_rules(rules, split)`

*   **Description:** Parses a list of rules and splits each rule by a given delimiter.
*   **Parameters:** `rules (list of str)` - A list of rule strings to be parsed. `split (str)` - The delimiter to split each rule string.
*   **Return Value:** `list of list of int` - A list where each element is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the rule strings.

### 2. `check_valid(rules, message)`

*   **Description:** Checks if a message is valid based on a set of rules.
*   **Parameters:** `rules (list of tuple)` - A list of tuples where each tuple contains two characters. `message (str)` - The message to be checked.
*   **Return Value:** `bool` - True if the message is valid according to the rules, False otherwise.

### 3. `main()`

*   **Description:** Main function to process input data, parse rules and messages, check for valid messages, 
    and compute a sum based on valid messages.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Return Value:** None

**Dependencies:**

The script depends on the following external packages/modules:

*   pyWrkspPackage - A package for loading data from files.

```python
# Importing necessary modules
import pyWrkspPackage  # pyWrkspPackage module for loading data from a file

# Define the main function to process input data, parse rules and messages, check for valid messages,
# and compute a sum based on valid messages.
def main():
    """
    Main function to process input data, parse rules and messages, check for valid messages, 
    and compute a sum based on valid messages.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Loads data from "input.txt" and splits it into lines.
    2. Parses the first 1177 lines as rules using '|' as the delimiter.
    3. Parses the remaining lines as messages using ',' as the delimiter.
    4. Checks each message against the parsed rules to determine validity.
    5. Collects all valid messages.
    6. Computes the sum of the middle character (as an integer) of each valid message.
    7. Prints the computed sum.

    # Load data from "input.txt" and split it into lines
    data = pyWrkspPackage.load_from_file("input.txt").split("\n")
    
    # Parse the first 1177 lines as rules using '|' as the delimiter
    rules = parse_rules(data[:1177], '|')

    messages = parse_rules(data[1178:], ',')

This documentation provides a clear overview of what the script does, lists all functions and classes defined in the script along with their descriptions, inputs, and outputs, and specifies the dependencies required by the script.

**Script Documentation**

**Summary**
------------

This Python script is designed to solve a challenge that involves reading input data from a file, processing the data, and returning a calculated sum. The script reads a list of numbers from a file, calculates the frequency of each number in a second list, multiplies each number by its corresponding frequency, and returns the sum of these products.

**Functions and Classes**
-------------------------

### do_challange()

*   **Description**: This function processes input data from a file, calculates the frequency of each number, and returns the sum of the products.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   None (input data is read from a file)
*   **Outputs**:
    *   An integer representing the calculated sum

### main()

*   **Description**: This function serves as the entry point for the script. It calls the `do_challange` function and prints the result.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   None
*   **Outputs**:
    *   None (prints the result of the `do_challange` function)

**Dependencies**
----------------

*   The script depends on the following external packages/modules:
    *   `os`: not used in this script
    *   `io`: not used in this script
    *   `sys`: used to check if the script is being run as the main program (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)
*   The script assumes that the following modules are available:
    *   `open()`
    *   `readlines()`
    *   `strip()`
    *   `split()`
    *   `enumerate()`

**Code**
------

```python
# Import necessary modules (none in this script)
import os  # not used
import io  # not used

def do_challange():
    """
    Process input data from a file, calculate the frequency of each number, 
    and return the sum of the products.

    Returns:
        int: The calculated sum
    """

    # Open the input file and read all lines into a list
    with open('input.txt') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    # Initialize two empty lists to store numbers from the files
    list_one = []
    list_two = []

    # Iterate over each line in the input data
    for line in lines:
        # Split the line into two parts, strip whitespace, and convert to integers
        spli = line.strip().split('   ')
        list_one.append(int(spli[0]))
        list_two.append(int(spli[1]))

    # Initialize an empty list to store frequencies of numbers
    amounts = []

    # Iterate over each number in the first list
    for num in list_one:
        amount = 0  # initialize frequency counter
        # Count the occurrences of the current number in the second list
        for num2 in list_two:
            if num2 == num:
                amount += 1
        amounts.append(amount)  # append frequency to the list

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of products
    sum = 0

    # Iterate over each index and number in the first list
    for index, num in enumerate(list_one):
        # Calculate the product of the current number and its frequency, add to the sum
        sum += num * amounts[index]

    # Return the calculated sum
    return sum


# Check if this script is being run as the main program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call the do_challange function and print the result
    print(do_challange())
```

Please note that I have made minor formatting changes to the original code while keeping it intact for documentation purposes.

**Script Documentation**

**Summary**
This Python script implements the logic of a classic puzzle game. It loads a 2D grid from a file, processes it based on a given direction, and updates the direction accordingly. The script continues to process the data until an IndexError occurs. Finally, it returns the count of 'X' characters in the data.

**Functions and Classes**

### `find_gaurd(data)`

*   Description: Finds the coordinates of the guard ('^') in a given 2D list.
*   Parameters:
    *   `data` (list of list of str): A 2D list representing the grid where each element is a string.
*   Returns:
    *   tuple: A tuple (x, y) representing the coordinates of the guard.

### `mainloop(data: list, direc: tuple)`

*   Description: Executes the main loop logic for processing the data based on the given direction.
*   Parameters:
    *   `data` (list): A 2D list representing the grid or map.
    *   `direc` (tuple): A tuple representing the current direction (dirx, diry).
*   Returns:
    *   tuple: A tuple containing the updated data and direction.

### `count(data)`

*   Description: Counts the number of occurrences of the character 'X' in a 2D list.
*   Parameters:
    *   `data` (list of list of str): A 2D list where each element is a string.
*   Returns:
    *   int: The count of 'X' characters found in the 2D list.

### `main()`

*   Description: Main function to execute the puzzle logic.
*   Parameters:
    None
*   Returns:
    int: The count of a specific condition in the data.

**Dependencies**

The script depends on the following external packages/modules:

*   `pyWrkspPackage`: A package for working with puzzles. This package is not part of the standard Python library and must be installed separately.

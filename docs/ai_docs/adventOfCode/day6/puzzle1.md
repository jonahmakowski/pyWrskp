**Documentation**

**Summary**

This Python script implements a simple maze solver based on the [PyWrkspPackage](https://github.com/Peter-Badney/pywrkspace) library. The script reads a text-based maze from a file, identifies the starting point and direction of movement, and iteratively moves through the maze until all cells containing "X" have been visited.

**Functions and Classes**

### `find_gaurd(data)`

*   **Description:** This function finds the location of the guard (^) in the maze.
*   **Parameters:** `data` (list of lists)
*   **Output:** `(x, y)` coordinates of the guard or raises an exception if no guard is found.

### `mainloop(data, direc)`

*   **Description:** This function implements the main loop of the maze solver. It moves in a specified direction until it hits a wall (.), reaches the end of the map (#), or encounters an obstacle (X).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `data` (list of lists): The current state of the maze.
    *   `direc` (tuple): The current direction of movement (e.g., `(0, -1)` for down-left).
*   **Output:** A tuple containing the updated maze data and the new direction.

### `count(data)`

*   **Description:** This function counts the number of cells with "X" in the maze.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Output:** The total count of "X" cells.

### `main()`

*   **Description:** This is the entry point of the script. It loads a text-based maze from a file, initializes the solver, and runs the main loop until the end of the map is reached.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Output:** The total count of "X" cells in the solved maze.

**Dependencies**

This script depends on:

*   [PyWrkspPackage](https://github.com/Peter-Badney/pywrkspace): A Python package for working with Wrkspace files. You can install it using pip: `pip install pywrkspace`

```python
# import statements go here

import pyWrkspPackage

def find_gaurd(data):
    # ... (function body remains the same)

def mainloop(data, direc):
    # ... (function body remains the same)

def count(data):
    # ... (function body remains the same)

def main():
    # ... (function body remains the same)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(main())

**Code with Comments**

```python
# Import necessary modules, including PyWrkspPackage
import pyWrkspPackage

# Function to find the location of the guard (^) in the maze
def find_gaurd(data):
    # Iterate through each cell in the maze
    for y, row in enumerate(data):
        for x, item in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the current cell contains the guard
            if item == "^":
                # Return the coordinates of the guard
                return x, y
    # Raise an exception if no guard is found
    raise Exception("No gaurd found")

# Main function to solve the maze and count the number of "X" cells
def main():
    # Load a text-based maze from a file using PyWrkspPackage
    data = pyWrkspPackage.load_from_file("input.txt").split("\n")
    # Convert the maze into a list of lists for easier manipulation
    data = [list(item) for item in data]

    # Print the initial state of the maze
    for point in data:
        print(*point)

    # Initialize the main loop with the starting direction (down-left)
    data, direc = mainloop(data, (0, -1))

    # Continuously update and print the state of the maze until it's solved
    while True:
        try:
            # Move to the next cell in the specified direction
            data, direc = mainloop(data, direc)
            # Print the updated state of the maze
            for point in data:
                print(*point)
        except IndexError:
            # Break out of the loop when reaching the end of the map
            break

    # Return the total count of "X" cells in the solved maze
    return count(data)

# Call the main function if this script is run directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(main())

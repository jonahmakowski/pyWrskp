# Script Documentation

## Program Overview

The provided script is designed to reload the current scene when a `Node2D` body enters the `Area2D`. This document will provide an overview of the script's functions and classes, along with explanations and examples.

## Table of Contents

Here is a table of contents listing all the functions and classes in the script:

* [Function `_on_body_entered`](#function-_on_body_entered)
    * Description: Reloads the current scene when a `Node2D` body enters the `Area2D`.
    * Parameters:
        * `body` (Node2D): The node that entered the `Area2D`.
    * Returns: None

## Detailed Function Descriptions

### Function `_on_body_entered`

Description: This function is triggered when a `Node2D` body enters the `Area2D`. It reloads the current scene.

Parameters:
* `body` (Node2D): The node that entered the `Area2D`.

Returns: None

## Example Usage

Usage example for `_on_body_entered`:

```python
# Assuming this function is connected to a signal in the Godot editor
# For example, in the Godot editor, you would connect the "body_entered" signal of an Area2D node to this function.

# When a Node2D enters the Area2D, the scene will be reloaded.
```

## Class Structure

The script extends the `Area2D` class and defines a single function `_on_body_entered`. This function is typically connected to the `body_entered` signal of an `Area2D` node in the Godot editor.

## Example Scene Setup

Here is an example of how you might set up a scene in Godot to use this script:

1. Create a new `Area2D` node.
2. Attach a script to the `Area2D` node and paste the provided script into it.
3. Connect the `body_entered` signal of the `Area2D` node to the `_on_body_entered` function in the script.

This setup ensures that when a `Node2D` enters the `Area2D`, the current scene will be reloaded.

# AI Summary
This file defines a coin object in a game. The coin has a value, which can be set using the init function. When the coin collides with another body, it increments the player's coin count by its value and then removes itself from the game.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand. However, the variable 'Stats' is not defined in the file, which could lead to errors if it's not properly initialized elsewhere in the codebase. The naming conventions are generally good, but the lack of type hints for the 'body' parameter in the '_on_area_2d_body_entered' function could be improved.

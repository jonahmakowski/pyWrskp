# AI Summary
This file defines a coin entity in a game. The coin can be initialized with a value and has the ability to move towards the player if certain conditions are met. It also handles interactions with other bodies in the game, such as when it enters an area with the player.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and functional, but there are some areas where it could be more concise. It follows the conventions of the Godot engine, but there are minor inconsistencies in naming and formatting.
# Functions

## init
### Explanation
Initializes the coin with a given value and determines if it should move towards the player based on a random chance and the coin retrieval percentage.
### Code
```gdscript
func init(v):
	value = v
	
	if randf() < float(Stats.coin_retrieval_percentage) / 100 and Stats.coin_retrieval_percentage != 0:
		to_player = true
```

## find_player
### Explanation
Finds and returns the player character in the game.
### Code
```gdscript
func find_player() -> CharacterBody2D:
	var player = null
	for child in get_parent().get_children():
		if child.is_in_group("player"):
			player = child
	
	return player
```

## _on_area_2d_body_entered
### Explanation
Handles the event when the coin enters an area with another body. It increments the player's coin count and removes the coin from the game.
### Code
```gdscript
func _on_area_2d_body_entered(_body: Node2D) -> void:
	Stats.coins += value
	queue_free()
```

## _physics_process
### Explanation
Handles the physics process for the coin. If the coin is set to move towards the player, it calculates the direction to the player and moves the coin accordingly.
### Code
```gdscript
func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
	if to_player:
		var player = find_player()
		var direction = global_position.direction_to(player.global_position)
		velocity = direction * Stats.COIN_MOVEMENT_SPEED
		move_and_slide()
```

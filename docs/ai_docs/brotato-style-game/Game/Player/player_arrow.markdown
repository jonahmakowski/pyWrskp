# AI Summary
This file defines a player arrow in a game, handling its initialization, movement, and destruction based on various conditions.

The AI gave it a general rating of 7/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 8/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and functional, but there are some areas where it could be more concise and adhere more strictly to Python conventions.
# Functions

## init
### Explanation
Initializes the player arrow with a target position and damage value.
### Code
```godot
func init(t, d):
	target = t
	damage = d
```

## _ready
### Explanation
Sets the initial rotation and velocity of the player arrow based on the target position.
### Code
```godot
func _ready():
	rotation = global_position.angle_to_point(target)
	direction = global_position.direction_to(target)
	velocity = direction * Stats.PROJECTILE_SPEED * Stats.projectile_speed_multiplyer
```

## _physics_process
### Explanation
Handles the physics processing of the player arrow, moving it along its path.
### Code
```godot
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	move_and_slide()
```

## _process
### Explanation
Checks if the player arrow has hit enough targets to be destroyed, based on the piercing stat.
### Code
```godot
func _process(_delta: float) -> void:
	if hits > Stats.piercing:
		queue_free()
```

## _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited
### Explanation
Destroys the player arrow when it exits the screen.
### Code
```godot
func _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited() -> void:
	queue_free()
```

# AI Summary
This file defines a CharacterBody2D node that represents an enemy arrow. It includes functions to find the player, set up the arrow's initial properties, handle physics processing, and handle screen exit events.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and functional, but there are some areas where it could be more concise or follow conventions more closely.
# Functions

## find_player
### Explanation
This function searches for a player object within the parent's children. It iterates through all children of the parent object and checks if any child is in the 'player' group. If a player is found, it returns the player object; otherwise, it returns null.
### Code
```gdscript
func find_player():
	var player = null
	for child in get_parent().get_children():
		if child.is_in_group("player"):
			player = child
	
	return player
```

## _ready
### Explanation
This function is called when the node is ready. It finds the player using the find_player function. If no player is found, it queues the node for deletion. Otherwise, it sets the rotation and direction of the node towards the player and sets the velocity of the node.
### Code
```gdscript
func _ready():
	var player = find_player()
	
	if player == null:
		queue_free()
		return
	
	rotation = global_position.angle_to_point(player.global_position)
	direction = global_position.direction_to(player.global_position)
	velocity = (direction * Stats.ENEMY_PROJECTILE_SPEED) * Stats.enemy_projectile_speed_multiplyer
```

## _physics_process
### Explanation
This function is called during the physics process. It moves and slides the node.
### Code
```gdscript
func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
	move_and_slide()
```

## _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited
### Explanation
This function is called when the node exits the screen. It queues the node for deletion.
### Code
```gdscript
func _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited() -> void:
	queue_free()
```

# Documentation for src/brotato-style-game/Game/Enemies/enemy_arrow.gd

# AI Summary
This script defines a CharacterBody2D node that represents an enemy arrow in a game. The arrow moves towards the player and is removed from the scene when it exits the screen. The script includes functions to find the player, set up the arrow's initial properties, handle physics, and manage the arrow's lifecycle.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 7/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is generally well-structured and functional, but there are some areas where it could be more concise. The variable naming is clear, and the code adheres to basic conventions, but there is room for improvement in terms of code organization and comments.
# Functions

## find_player
### Explanation
This function searches for a player object within the game scene. It iterates through all children of the parent node and checks if any of them are in the 'player' group. If a player is found, it returns the player object; otherwise, it returns null.
### Code
```gdscript
func find_player():
	var player = null
	for child in get_parent().get_children():
		if child.is_in_group("player"):
			player = child
	
	return player
```

## _ready
### Explanation
This function is called when the node is added to the scene tree. It finds the player using the find_player function. If no player is found, it removes the node from the scene tree. Otherwise, it sets the rotation and direction of the node towards the player and sets the velocity of the node.
### Code
```gdscript
func _ready():
	var player = find_player()
	
	if player == null:
		queue_free()
		return
	
	rotation = global_position.angle_to_point(player.global_position)
	direction = global_position.direction_to(player.global_position)
	velocity = (direction * Stats.ENEMY_PROJECTILE_SPEED) * Stats.enemy_projectile_speed_multiplyer
```

## _physics_process
### Explanation
This function is called during the physics process. It moves the node according to its velocity.
### Code
```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	move_and_slide()
```

## _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited
### Explanation
This function is called when the node exits the screen. It removes the node from the scene tree.
### Code
```gdscript
func _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_exited() -> void:
	queue_free()
```

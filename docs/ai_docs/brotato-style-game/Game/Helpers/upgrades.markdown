# Functions

## _ready
### Explanation
This function initializes the upgrades_with_weights array by populating it with each upgrade repeated according to its weight. This is done to create a weighted random selection mechanism.
### Code
```gdscript
func _ready():
	for u in all_upgrades:
		var weight = u.weight
		for i in range(weight):
			upgrades_with_weights.append(u)
```

## get_random_upgrade
### Explanation
This function selects and returns a random upgrade from the upgrades_with_weights array. The selection is weighted based on the initial weights assigned to each upgrade.
### Code
```gdscript
func get_random_upgrade() -> upgrade:
	var index = randi_range(0, len(upgrades_with_weights)-1)
	return upgrades_with_weights[index]
```
# Overall File Contents

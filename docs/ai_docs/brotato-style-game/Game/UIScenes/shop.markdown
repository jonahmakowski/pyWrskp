# AI Summary
This script defines a Control node that manages a collection of weapons with weighted random selection. The _ready function initializes the weighted weapon list, and the get_random_weapon function allows for the selection of a random weapon based on the predefined weights.

The AI gave it a general rating of 8/10

The AI gave it a conventions rating of 9/10

The reason for the AI's rating is:

The code is well-structured and follows GDScript conventions. The functionality is clear and concise, with appropriate use of arrays and loops. The naming conventions are clear and descriptive.
# Functions

## _ready
### Explanation
This function initializes the weapons_with_weights array by appending each weapon multiple times based on its weight. This allows for weighted random selection of weapons.
### Code
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
	for w in weapons:
		for i in range(w.weight):
			weapons_with_weights.append(w)
```

## get_random_weapon
### Explanation
This function selects and returns a random weapon from the weapons_with_weights array. The selection is weighted based on the initial weights assigned to each weapon.
### Code
```gdscript
func get_random_weapon():
	var index = randi_range(0, len(weapons_with_weights) - 1)
	return weapons_with_weights[index]
```
# Overall File Contents

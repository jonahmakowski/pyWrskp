Diverse notes.

conda --------------------------------------------
see: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html

Interaction through the cmd-line (terminal)
Lines that start with the $ are actual (but without $) exec-commands

Configure conda's priority channel (recommended); it modifies ~/.condarc)
$ conda config --prepend channels conda-forge

Update the conda base:
$ conda update --all
$ conda update -d --all
the second line (-d option) is a dry run (i.e., only shows what would be done
without -d option)

For actual work it is recommended to create a conda environment. Such env
can be used not only by python/pycharm but also by many other apps. All
apps/libs/packages are installed in a selected env. As long as there is no
conflict between versions of the installed elements, one env can be used for
many projects.

To create env:
$ conda create --name pyWrksp
(other names can be used; preferably a name should be easily associated with
a set of py-projects)


To list created env:
$ conda info --env

To start working in an (e.g., pyWrksp) env:
$ conda activate pyWrksp
to leave the env:
$ conda deactivate

After an env is activated, the prompt should show it. E.g,:
(your prompt will be different; it depends on the shell, set-up, usr-name, etc)
Ba4:~ marek$ conda activate pyWrksp
(pyWrksp) Ba4:~ marek$

To list packages available in an env:
$ conda list
(a newly created env will have no packages)

Packages are installed by:
$conda install xxx
where xxx is/are the name/names of packages to be installed.
I suggest to install the following (each will install the newest but
compatible version; also the minimum set of needed packages):
$ conda install python
At any point of the installation you can run:
$ conda list
to see all installed packages
$conda install jupyter
(installation of jupyter will slightly downgrade python; this is necessary
to keep them working together)

The below will install package you will sooner or later need:
$ conda install numpy pandas plotly scipy seaborn dash

From time to time check for updates of packages (see the commands above)

If a package cannot be installed by conda install, then install it
(within an active conda env!) by pip; this will ensure that versions of
all packages are compatible.


Pycharm -------------------------------------------------------------------

To add py-interpreter from a conda env to the selected project
- go (within existing project) to
	pycharm/preferences/project/project interpreter
- click "the wheel" (small icon right to the list of Python interprets)
- select Add...
- select Conda Environemnt  (left side of the new panel)
- select: Existing environment
- in the list find the location of the pyWrksp, e.g.:
	~/anaconda3/envs/pyWrksp/bin/python3.10
- wait until the list of packages will be complete (Last version displayed)
- click Apply
- click OK
